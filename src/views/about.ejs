          I was born in Sandy Utah and lived there until 1999 when my dad got a
          new engineering job we moved to the Seattle area. I graduated from
          Lake Stevens High School in 2006. Spent a few months just saving some
          money until I went on a 2 year volunteer church mission, I went to
          Guyana and Trinidad each for a year.

          When I got back I mostly worked in a few different sales positions
          then met my wife she made me wait for her to serve a volunteer mission
          in South Korea for 18 months. We got married in 2013. When I was
          getting married I decided to man up and got my real estate license. I
          still have my license today.

          After working some time in sales and as a real estate agent, I decided
          to return to school to pursue my passion and become a web/app
          developer. At first I thought I was just going to go and get certified
          as a front end developer but for that certification at the school I
          selected they make us take an into to programming class, that opened
          up my eyes. I found that I love to program so I switched things up and
          decided to do the 2 year degree and learn how to do the back end and
          how to program for iOS and Android. I took to it so well that my
          instructors hired me to be an “embedded” tutor. I even tutored
          students that were ahead of me in the program.
