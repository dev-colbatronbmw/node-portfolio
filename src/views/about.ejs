        <p>
          I am a builder, from my personal life to my professional one. I thrive
          by creating things and fixing any problems that are in my way. As a
          developer, building beautiful-looking and beautifully-running
          applications is what drives me. I love to utilize efficient code for
          back-end and databases for use in user-based web and native
          environments. Whether it be building cars, businesses, or websites,
          completion of difficult projects gives me immense joy.

        <h4 class="heading">History</h4>
        <p>
          I was born in Sandy Utah and lived there until 1999 when my dad got a
          new engineering job we moved to the Seattle area. I graduated from
          Lake Stevens High School in 2006. Spent a few months just saving some
          money until I went on a 2 year volunteer church mission, I went to
          Guyana and Trinidad each for a year.

          When I got back I mostly worked in a few different sales positions
          then met my wife she made me wait for her to serve a volunteer mission
          in South Korea for 18 months. We got married in 2013. When I was
          getting married I decided to man up and got my real estate license. I
          still have my license today.

        <p>
          After working some time in sales and as a real estate agent, I decided
          to return to school to pursue my passion and become a web/app
          developer. At first I thought I was just going to go and get certified
          as a front end developer but for that certification at the school I
          selected they make us take an into to programming class, that opened
          up my eyes. I found that I love to program so I switched things up and
          decided to do the 2 year degree and learn how to do the back end and
          how to program for iOS and Android. I took to it so well that my
          instructors hired me to be an “embedded” tutor. I even tutored
          students that were ahead of me in the program.

        <h4 class="heading">Hobbies</h4>
        <p>
          I really do like to build things. My biggest hobby is to drive older
          BMWs. What started with me has spread to my family we now have 10
          BMWs. My main car and daily driver for the last 12 years is a 1986 e30
          325es. I got it for $600 and have fixed every single thing on it. I
          have even replaced the motor myself. <a href="#">Read More…</a>

          I also like to tinker with small electronics. I have added bluetooth
          to the original stereo in my BMW. I have a lot of raspberry pi
          projects. But with these kind of projects they are the ones that
          always take a back seat to my cars so I have a lot of un-finished rasp
          pi projects I guess.
