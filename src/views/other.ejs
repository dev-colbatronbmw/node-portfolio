        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I really do not know
        that to call this page. Here I have a collection of things that I am
        proud of and things that may be good to know about me as a person. I am
        someone who really loves people I know that is really odd to find in
        many coders. And I don’t mean that in a negative way. As far as I’ve sen
        most coders just have a shell that needs cracking. Not only have I
        cracked I have hatched into a beautiful majestic golden eagle. I have
        spent my entire adult life in sales, and really only because I love
        people. I have been in real estate for the last 7 years. My role as an
        agent was not the usual and normally takes some explaining. I worked for
        a listing agency that listed and sold homes for multiple new home
        builders. My job was to take all incoming leads from calls, email, and
        live chat. That came in for all the builders that my listing agency sold
        homes for, At one point we were up to 9 builders and something around 30
        communities. I was on call 24/7, if I missed a call at 2:00am my boss
        knew it and would sometimes call me in the morning and call me out on
        it. I loved doing that but as the company switched to new ownership they
        lost many of the builders that they were listing for and could no longer
        keep me around. So I kind of switched to doing general real estate but I
        took a long hard look at what I wanted to do for my career and real
        estate was not it. I have liked to tinker with techy things and had done
        an HTML/CSS bootcamp weekend a few years before and decided to take the
        dive. It has gone amazingly well.
