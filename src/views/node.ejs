            Welcome to My Node.js Website. I am making my portfolio available in
            several languages. I started here with Node because it was the last
            thing I did in school. The other sites from the landing page will
            also be available as soon as they are complete. For this site I am
            having it hosted on my personal site. The other ones will be hosted
            for free on heroku. Please explore and take a look and please give
            me feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this time much of the site is under construction, minimal styling
            until I get done with the other parts of this site.
